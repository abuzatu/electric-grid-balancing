# Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Example

## üè≠ Overview

This Virtual Power Plant (VPP) example demonstrates how distributed energy resources can be coordinated to act as a single power plant, optimizing market participation and grid services.

## üéØ What is a Virtual Power Plant?

A VPP is a **network of distributed energy resources** that are coordinated to act like a single power plant. Unlike traditional power plants that exist in one location, a VPP aggregates resources across multiple locations and optimizes their operation for maximum value.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Distributed Resources**: Solar, wind, batteries, demand response
- **Market Participation**: Optimized bidding in electricity markets
- **Stochastic Optimization**: Handles price uncertainty
- **Grid Services**: Provides flexibility and stability
- **Revenue Maximization**: Optimizes timing of generation/consumption

## üë• Business Model & Actors

### 1. VPP Aggregator (The "Orchestrator")
```
Name: GreenGrid_VPP
Role: Coordinates all distributed resources
Revenue: Market participation and optimization services
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinate all distributed resources
- Optimize when each resource generates/consumes
- Participate in electricity markets
- Manage contracts with resource owners
- Handle market settlements and payments

### 2. Resource Owners (The "Suppliers")

#### Private Households
```
Example: Home with solar panels + battery
- Solar panels: 5 kW capacity
- Home battery: 10 kWh storage
- Owner: Individual homeowner
- Contract: Sell excess power to VPP aggregator
```

#### Commercial Entities
```
Example: Industrial facility with demand response
- Factory with flexible load
- Can reduce consumption during high-price periods
- Owner: Industrial company
- Contract: Get paid for load reduction
```

#### Utility Companies
```
Example: Large battery storage facility
- 20 MW battery system
- Owner: Utility company
- Contract: Provide storage services to VPP
```

#### Renewable Energy Developers
```
Example: Solar farm
- 50 MW solar farm
- Owner: Renewable energy company
- Contract: Sell power through VPP
```

## üí∞ Revenue Streams & Profit Distribution

### Market Revenue Example
```
High Price Period: $72/MWh
- Solar farm generates: 50 MW √ó $72 = $3,600/hour
- Battery discharges: 20 MW √ó $72 = $1,440/hour
- Total revenue: $5,040/hour

Low Price Period: $4/MWh  
- Battery charges: 20 MW √ó $4 = $80/hour
- Net profit from arbitrage
```

### Profit Distribution
```
VPP Aggregator Revenue: $5,040/hour
- Payment to solar farm: $3,200/hour (negotiated rate)
- Payment to battery: $1,200/hour (negotiated rate)
- Market fees: $50/hour
- Aggregator profit: $590/hour ‚úÖ
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Resource Types in Our VPP

#### 1. Solar Farm
```python
{
    'name': 'Solar_Farm_1',
    'type': 'solar',
    'capacity': 50.0,  # MW
    'owner': 'Residential_Cooperative',
    'availability_profile': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, ...]
}
```

#### 2. Wind Farm
```python
{
    'name': 'Wind_Farm_1',
    'type': 'wind', 
    'capacity': 30.0,  # MW
    'owner': 'Commercial_Investor',
    'availability_profile': [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, ...]
}
```

#### 3. Battery Storage
```python
{
    'name': 'Battery_Storage_1',
    'type': 'battery',
    'capacity': 20.0,  # MW (power rating)
    'energy_capacity': 80.0,  # MWh (energy storage)
    
    # SOC (State of Charge) Parameters
    'min_soc': 0.1,  # 10% minimum state of charge
    'max_soc': 0.9,  # 90% maximum state of charge
    'initial_soc': 0.5,  # 50% initial state of charge
    'efficiency': 0.9,  # 90% round-trip efficiency
}
```

#### 4. Demand Response
```python
{
    'name': 'Demand_Response_1',
    'type': 'demand_response',
    'capacity': 15.0,  # MW (reduction capacity)
    'owner': 'Industrial_Customer',
    'variable_cost': 15.0,  # $/MWh (incentive payment)
}
```

### Battery State of Charge (SOC) Modeling

The VPP includes comprehensive battery SOC modeling:

#### SOC Variables:
- **SOC(t)**: State of charge at time t (0.1 to 0.9, i.e., 10% to 90%)
- **charge(t)**: Charging power at time t (0 to max_charge_rate)
- **discharge(t)**: Discharging power at time t (0 to max_discharge_rate)

#### SOC Evolution Equation:
```
SOC(t) = SOC(t-1) + (charge(t-1) * efficiency - discharge(t-1) / efficiency) / energy_capacity
```

Where:
- efficiency = 0.9 (90% round-trip efficiency)
- energy_capacity = 80 MWh (total battery capacity)

#### SOC Constraints:
- min_soc ‚â§ SOC(t) ‚â§ max_soc (10% to 90%)
- SOC(0) = initial_soc (50% at start)
- Energy balance enforced through separate charge/discharge variables
