# Intro

This repo contains optimisation problems for electric grid balancing, such as unit commitment and virtual power plants. With the code of backend with open source solvers with OR-Tools and a streamlit app for frontend. Also available to explore in Jupyter Notebooks. And all in a Docker container, to be able to deployed in a VPS server or the cloud, to make the app it accessible. In the app the input parameters can be added or modified, and constraints can be turned on and off, to visualise how the results change.
